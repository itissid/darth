MyChores
========

A simple stab at an better way to enter chores into android apps.
This app is more to perhaps get familiar with the android system and
build an app I will use for assiging chores around our bachelor pad. 


Outcomes: Learning about android from scratch like framework lifecycle,content providers, Fragments, UI Input widgets etc. 
And ofcourse Much more...
